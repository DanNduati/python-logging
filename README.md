# Python Logging
Python provides a logging system as a part of its standard library, so you can quickly add logging to your application. By logging useful data from the right places, you can not only debug errors easily but also use the data to analyze the performance of the application to plan for scaling or look at usage patterns to plan for marketing.

## The logging module
With the logging module imported, you can use something called a “logger” to log messages that you want to see. By default, there are 5 standard levels indicating the severity of events.  
* DEBUG
* INFO
* WARNING
* ERROR
* CRITICAL
